# Mitigating Data Heterogeneity in Federated Learning with Data Augmentation

This repository contains the implementation details of the work "Mitigating Data Heterogeneity in Federated Learning with Data Augmentation".
It contains different algorithms in both Federated Learning and Domain Generalization, as well as auxilary methods for the experimental setup.
We currently support the following algorithms:

### Federated Learning
* Federated Averaging (FedAvg, [McMahan et al., 2017](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v54/mcmahan17a/mcmahan17a.pdf)) 
* Agnostic Federated Learning (AFL, [Mohri et al., 2019](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/mohri19a/mohri19a.pdf))
* FedProx (FedProx, [Li et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06127))
* Generalized AFL (Gen-AFL)
* Variance Minimization (VM)
* Federated IRM (Fed-IRM)

### Domain Generalization
* Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM, [Vapnik et al., 1991](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/1991/file/ff4d5fbbafdf976cfdc032e3bde78de5-Paper.pdf))
* Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM, [Arjovski et al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02893))
* Distributionally Robust Neural Networks for Group Shifts (GroupDRO, [Sagawa et al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08731))
* Minimax Risk Extrapolation (MM-REx, [Krueger et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.00688))
* Variance Risk Extrapolation (V-REx, [Krueger et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.00688)) 

## Dependencies
This repository was developed under Python 3.6.9, with the following packages
* torch 1.8.0
* torchvision 0.9.0
* scipy
* matplotlib
* numpy
* tqdm

Install the dependencies by running:
``pip install .``

## Datasets
We currently support the following datasets:
* RotatedMNIST ([Ghifary et al., 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.07680))
* PACS ([Li et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.03077))
* OfficeHome ([Venkateswara et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.07522))

For RotatedMNIST, the dataset is automatically downloaded once the corresponding functions are called.
As for PACS and OfficeHome, datasets must be manually downloaded and placed inside the `data/datasets/` folder.
Additionally, subfolders must be in the following structure:
* PACS (`P, A, C, and S`)
* OfficeHome (`Art, Clipart, Product, and RealWorld`)

## Experiments
Once the dependencies have been installed and the datasets are in place, refer to the `scripts/` folder to execute the experiments.
For instance, the following command illustrates how to run FedAvg on Rotated MNIST 
* The following command illustrates how to run FedAvg on Rotated MNIST with 15Â° rotation:
```sh
python scripts/fl_rmnist.py --alg fed_avg --steps 200 --rounds 80 --data da_15 --seed 0
```

By default the experiments are stored in `data/experiments/`. Remember to modify the folder name when running similar experiments multiple times, so that the output files won't be overwritten.
